# Python samples

Python/OpenTelemetry samples that are not tied to a specific web framework (see `flask/` and `fastapi/` for those). Suggested subfolders: `hello-http`, `grpc`, `background-tasks`, `auto-vs-manual`.

| Sample | What it shows | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _tbd_ | – | planned |

Use `templates/SAMPLE_README.md` to document each app.
